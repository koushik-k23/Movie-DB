The folder contains 3 subfolders (Pages,Partials,public).
The remaining files in the main folder are needed to execute the server with FULL functionality.
The project report document is uploaded on cuLearn. 

NOTE: THE FOLDER DOES NOT CONTAIN A DATABASE FOLDER AND THE 
node_modules. THESE FOLDERS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THE SERVER.JS FILE.

Steps to execute server:
1) Make a directory inside of this folder. Please name it as 'db'.
2) In your command line, inside this project directory, enter npm install.
3) Run mongod on another terminal window.
4) Exectute the db-initializer.js. The process will end with a status of 
'Finished :)'.
    -> side note: Thank you Professor McKinney for the database initializer
    file you had provided on Discord. The initializer file establishes 
    collections for movies, people and users. We created 4 users to use.
5) Exectute the Server2.0.js file. While the server is running, go to the url
(your terminal will display the url). When you're at the url, you will be forced
to either sign in or sign up. You can use either of the users provided in the 
dh-initializer.js file, or you can sign up and create a new profile. 
6) Once you have logged in or signed up, the site will direct the user to the homepage.
From there, you can navigate to any of the links and functionalities.

Thank your Professor McKinney and the TA's for all the help and support you had provided us.
It was an amazing learning experience! Have a great summer!
